# ü§ñ AI Job Interview Chatbot Project

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot designed to help job seekers prepare for interviews. The chatbot generates dynamic interview questions, analyzes user responses, and provides constructive feedback to improve the user's performance.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Response Analysis**: NLP-driven analysis of user responses to provide feedback.
- **Customizable**: Users can upload their own interview question datasets in JSON format.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate suggestions to improve response quality.
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages**:
  - Python (backend logic and AI model integration)
  - Streamlit (frontend interface)
- **Libraries**:
  - Hugging Face Transformers (for NLP models)
  - JSON (for dataset handling)
- **Cloud Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud for deployment


### üì¶ Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`. Here is the list of libraries needed for the project:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/skyish21/job-interview-chatbot.git
```
2. Upload Your Own Dataset
You can upload a custom dataset of interview questions in JSON format. The JSON should be structured as follows:
bash
```
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "technical",
      "question": "Explain the difference between TCP and UDP."
    },
    {
      "type": "behavioral",
      "question": "Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work."
    }
  ]
}
```
3. Run the Application
After installing dependencies and uploading your custom dataset (if any), run the Streamlit application:
bash
```
streamlit run app.py
```
## üìÇ Project Structure
- app.py: Main Streamlit application file.
- utils/: Contains utility scripts for question generation and response analysis.
-- question_generator.py: Handles question generation from Hugging Face models.
-- response_analysis.py: Analyzes responses and provides feedback.
- dataset/: Folder containing the sample interview question datasets in JSON format.

## üöÄ Future Scope

- **Multi-language Support**: Integrate multilingual capabilities so that the chatbot can provide interview preparation in various languages, making it accessible to a wider audience.
  
- **Voice Interaction**: Add voice recognition and voice synthesis features, enabling users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands, mimicking real interview scenarios.
  
- **Advanced Feedback**: Implement more detailed and personalized feedback based on the quality of responses, such as suggestions on tone, body language (with video input), or confidence level.
  
- **Integration with Job Portals**: Enable integration with popular job portals like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc., to provide personalized interview practice based on specific job roles, industries, and companies.
  
- **Real-time Performance Tracking**: Develop a feature that tracks the user‚Äôs progress over time, offering insights into how their interview skills have improved.
  
- **AI-based Personality Assessment**: Build an AI-based system that assesses personality traits from user responses to tailor questions, providing feedback on traits like confidence, communication skills, and problem-solving ability.
